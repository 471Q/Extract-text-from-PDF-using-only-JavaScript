# Extract-text-from-PDF-using-only-JavaScript
Usually text extraction from PDF is done using back-end, but for one of my project I needed it done with only JavaScript. It is not impossible but very confusing to make the library work. This repository is created for future reference. I do not own the library, I merely changed some parts of it to make it work.
